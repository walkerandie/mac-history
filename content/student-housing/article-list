        "content": "In her book exploring the history of student housing in the United States, art historian Carla Yanni argues that “the architecture of dormitories has participated in the establishment of the essential norms of American life.” At American colleges, dormitories have served as a way to educate young adults about how to live with one another before they go out into the real world. At Macalester, dorms and the rules implemented within their walls have shaped how students sleep, eat, party, make friends, and have sex. In particular, the design and operation of dorms at Macalester has consistently centered around the college’s philosophy of gender and sexuality. Originally, the college hoped to instill students with traditional gender roles through strict rules and separation by sex. Over time, as national attitudes changed and students challenged these rules, Macalester’s philosophy on student housing has moved away from its reliance on a binary understanding of gender— but not without challenges and missteps along the way.",

        "title": "Admitting female students & Neill controversy ",
        "content": "Within a few years of Macalester’s founding, a new challenge would emerge in accommodating the student body on campus: women. Macalester first admitted two women in the fall of 1893. In some ways, this was not a major change for the institution. The precursor to Macalester, the Baldwin School, had served a majority of female students, and the ability to accept more students to the college meant more tuition, something the college certainly needed. However, this new development went against the wishes of Macalester’s founder, Edward Duffield Neill, who declared that he would not step foot on campus while the college educated women. As the story goes, President Ringland visited Neill at his home one day in hopes of discussing the issue. Neill was often characterized as quick to anger, and so it is not unlikely that the two men argued. After their meeting, President Ringland left Neill’s home, and later that afternoon, Neill suffered a heart attack and died. The incident was certainly a dramatic way to mark the introduction of women to Macalester, and made it clear that women would not be able to follow the same path as their male counterparts during their time at the college. Over the next several decades, Macalester administrators would frequently limit the freedom of female students in the name of educating and disciplining them appropriately.",

        "title": "Deans of Women and dorm architecture",
        "content": "In the early 1900s, women were seen as having different needs from men when it came to education and student housing. Female students at colleges and universities in the United States, including Macalester, were often overseen by deans of women, who were responsible for “their charges’ involvement with cars, mixed-gender houses, food, and sex,” as described by Yanni. Architecture was one way that college administrators could oversee their students and ensure their safety and morality. In 1897, the college hired its first female professor, Julia Johnson, who also took on the role of Dean of Women and served as the house mother for The Elms, the residence for women located in the former president’s home. Residents of the Elms contributed an hour of work each day assisting the matron of the house— providing a way for women to learn how to properly manage a home. However, a dormitory designed specially for women would be ideal— it would keep them out of boardinghouses, which were seen as in opposition to a healthy learning environment, what with their lack of supervision and isolation from campus, and it would allow for special considerations for the wellbeing of female students in particular. As the student body grew, it was clear that a much larger building would be needed to house female students. and plans were drawn up for what would become Wallace Hall.",

        "title": "Wallace Hall-- Marketing and Design",
        "content": "Great care was taken in the building and marketing of Wallace as suitable for its female occupants. Although college administrators were fine with housing male students in various places, ranging from the original dormitory in the East Wing of Old Main, to the clubs at Edwards and Eutrophian Halls, and off campus, they carefully arranged housing accommodations for women. Wallace Hall is listed in the 1906 College Catalog as “so arranged that sunlight will fall into every room [...] The whole building will have every modern appointment and be absolutely fireproof. ” Wallace was designed to be a beautiful and safe place for the women of Macalester to live, with all the amenities they might need. The first floor featured a large dining hall, parlors for entertaining, and the office and quarters of the matron, while the second and third floors held bedrooms and communal bathrooms for residents. The layout of the rooms followed traditional conventions in the design of dormitories for women, with double-loaded corridors— making it easier to keep an eye on the comings and goings of students and their guests. In the basement, there was a gymnasium for residents to practice physical education, as recommended by the college— physical education was yet another way that the college viewed as essential in caring for female students and ensuring their health. The construction of Wallace also helped to improve Macalester’s image and served as a draw for potential new students. The 1906 College Catalog features an illustration of Wallace Hall prominently on its first page, with Edwardian silhouetted women walking along the tree-lined sidewalk and standing in the doorways. Later, the catalog writes arrogantly that “[i]t is believed that no building of its kind west of Chicago can approach it or be compared with it in plan and equipment.” At the time, Macalester was still a young institution and had little reputation to speak of, and a beautiful new residence hall with modern appointments was an opportunity to attract new students and present the college as a reputable place to live and learn. The flowery description in the catalog and the illustration of the hall helped to paint an idyllic picture of Macalester for prospective students— especially women, who had special needs that had to be taken into consideration.",

        "title": "Dorm life in the early 1900s",
        "content": "Looking into student experiences helps to show how college leaders continued to prioritize keeping relations between men and women as limited and chaste as possible in the early 1900s— often to the detriment of women in particular. Wallace Hall had been constructed at a safe distance from the men’s dormitory located in the East Wing of Old Main, which women were prohibited from entering anyways. There were many similar rules in place just for women, ostensibly to keep them out of trouble. Del Laughlin, class of 1913 and president of the student government association, wrote a short article for the Macalester Bulletin in 1912 describing the different places students lived and the associations in charge of them. In Old Main, thirty men lived together in what Laughlin described as “the best arranged rooms on the campus,” while others lived in the wooden frame house on campus called Edwards Hall, a nearby boarding club called Euthenian Hall, or rented rooms in private homes. However, Laughlin writes, “chief in interest among Macalester dormitories is Wallace Hall, with its sixty-seven fair inmates.” According to Laughlin, dorm life was luxurious for the fair women of Wallace, similar to how the college had marketed the hall. Speaking for the men of Macalester, he wrote that Wallace Hall, “with its beautiful location, [...] its sunny dining room, and its spacious parlors, makes the accommodations for the sterner sex seem by contrast even more crude and inadequate.” However,  “the girls [had to be] ‘in’ at 7:30 p. m. except by special permission” from the Dean of Women, and “lights [were] out and doors [were] locked at 10:30” each night.  On the other hand, Laughlin explains that in the men’s dormitory, the philosophy was that “every man is permitted to come, go, and do as he pleases so long as he neither breaks the rules of the college nor infringes upon the rights of the other fellow.” Living on campus meant agreeing to be subjected to the college’s rules, which often relied on double standards for women, a disparity that would last for decades.",
