During the interwar period, Macalester continued to grow and made lofty plans for the future. [Context about President Acheson]

In 1926, Kirk Hall was constructed to house male students, the first dormitory for men constructed since the East Wing of Old Main. The dorm was built on the ‘quadrangle plan’, following in the footsteps of many universities, including the oft-revered campuses of Cambridge and Oxford. [Details from Living on Campus, other case studies. Quadrangles as an implementation of the panopticon.]

In 1929, President Acheson developed a new plan in 1929 to revamp the college’s curriculum and mission, which included a comprehensive plan for new facilities. The plan would lead to the construction of “at least six new buildings: a library, a classroom and administrative building, a science building, a chapel, a fine arts building, and a student activities building, each of which would be equipped with the most modern of facilities.” [Information from archival materials: plans, drawings] Unfortunately, the financial troubles of the Great Depression meant that Acheson’s plans had to be shelved, and they weren’t realized until after Acheson’s death. With the Great Depression, enrollment dropped, and the college had to reduce tuition in order to entice students back to the school. Funding received from rent on college owned property, primarily farmland in the north of Minnesota, dropped sharply. Any sort of college expansion would have to be put on hold.
