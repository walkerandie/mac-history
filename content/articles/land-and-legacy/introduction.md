Institutions of higher education have long histories of contributing to settler colonialism in the United States, and Macalester is no exception. The history of Macalester’s campus is of course, also the history of the land it occupies and the colonial power structures that have shaped it. Understanding how those power structures have shaped Macalester can help us begin to address the harmful power dynamics resulting from colonialism to this day. 

Macalester College was initially the endeavor of only one man: Edward Duffield Neill. In the past, history has often relied on a narrative that highlights so-called ‘great men,’ lifting them up as heroes, founding fathers, and role models for the future. However, Neill’s role in the history of Macalester College is far from heroic. Without his initiative, there would be no Macalester College. However, many aspects of his approach to education and politics are now at odds with what the Macalester community has become.
