Institutions of higher education have long histories of contributing to settler colonialism in the United States, and Macalester is no exception. The history of Macalester’s campus is of course, also the history of the land it occupies and the colonial power structures that have shaped it. Understanding how those power structures have shaped Macalester can help us begin to address the harmful power dynamics resulting from colonialism to this day. 

The land that Macalester stands on today is made up of the homeland of the Dakota people. However, through deceptive negotiations and settler colonialist policies, the United States government took control of the land, establishing the state of Minnesota and the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis.[^1] In particular, Macalester’s colonial history has been embodied by its founder, Edward Duffield Neill. In the past, history has often relied on a narrative that highlights so-called ‘great men,’ lifting them up as heroes, founding fathers, and role models for the future. However, Neill’s role in history is far from heroic. In addition to his efforts to reform education, Neill was active in Minnesota politics and espoused dehumanizing views towards indigenous people. In an [1868 letter](https://dwlibrary.macalester.edu/counterbalance/types/texts/letter-from-edward-d-neill-to-hon-n-g-taylor-effort-and-failure-to-civilize-the-aborigines/), Neill took a stand against recognizing indigenous nations, and refers to Native people as “degraded” and “savage.”[^2]  Neill instead advocated for forcing Native people to assimilate into American culture. Without Neill’s initiative, there would be no Macalester College. However, many aspects of his approach to education and politics are now at odds with the college’s values and what Macalester community has become.
