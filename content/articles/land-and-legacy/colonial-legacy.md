Today, the founding days of Macalester and the decisions made about its location have taken on greater significance as the nation and the college begin to reckon with their colonial histories. In 2019, student journalists for the _Mac Weekly_ published a special edition of the college newspaper, _Colonial Macalester, _reporting on Macalester founder Edward Duffield Neill’s hearty endorsement of white supremacism, his involvement in enforcing settler colonialism in Minnesota, and his rejection of co-education.[^1] Their reporting led many Macalester community members to reconsider the history of the institution of Macalester and its founder, and it ultimately had a tangible impact on Macalester’s campus. In 2013, Macalester’s Board of Trustees voted to give the Humanities Building a new name: Neill Hall. The renaming was a part of a campus-wide effort to improve wayfinding, and the name change had been suggested to reduce confusion, given that many departments in the humanities were actually housed in Old Main, rather than the Humanities Building. However, after the release of _Colonial Macalester,_ the college chose to remove Neill’s name from the building and revert it to its original name: the Humanities Building.
