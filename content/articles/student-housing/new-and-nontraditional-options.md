The options for student housing at Macalester continued to diversify after co-ed dorms were established for the first time in 1969. Over the next few decades, more options would become available to students that differed from the traditional dormitory setup. Students could now choose where to live based on their academic interests or cultural and religious backgrounds. As a part of the college’s Expanded Educational Opportunities (EEO) program, Macalester opened Black House in 1969, and Hispanic House in 1974, giving students new places to live, hang out, and host events to build community.[^1] Those houses were eventually consolidated into the new Cultural House in the 1980s after the end of EEO. In 1970, Macalester’s first language houses opened, offering students the chance to practice speaking another language with their peers at home.[^2] Hebrew House opened in 1972, providing Jewish students the opportunity to live together and giving them a space that served as a cultural and religious center.
