## Evolving Philosophies of Gender

More recently, gendered divisions in student housing have continued to evolve. In 2008, the college designated a section of Kirk Hall as an all-gender community, after the proposal initially made national headlines.

Every hall on campus houses students of all genders, and since 2008, a section of Kirk has been designated as an all-gender community. Questions of gender and student housing remain controversial topics. In the fall of 2022, the Mac Weekly published an article sharing the stories of transgender and nonbinary students who were not offered the chance to live in all-gender housing. The intersection of issues of gender identity and housing continues to push the college to define its stance on what it means to educate young adults about living independently.
