          <p>Edward Duffield Neill was born in 1823, and had a privileged childhood in Philadelphia, eventually attending prep school for two years before enrolling at Amherst College when he was 16.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Amherst College, founded in Massachusetts in 1821, would profoundly shape Neill’s worldview, and remained his central inspiration as he worked to establish Macalester later in life.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Amherst emphasized a close relationship between students and faculty, hoping to instill students with critical thinking skills as well as a distinct devotion to God.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Neill would later endeavor to bring this Amherst style of education westward.</p>

<p>After graduating from Amherst, Neill briefly explored career options in business and the military, before settling on attending Andover Theological Seminary in Massachusetts.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> A career in ministry was not an uncommon choice for a college graduate at the time, and after his time at the seminary, Neill was left with a passion for evangelical Presbyterianism and a future that would surely be defined by his interest in religious education.</p>

<p>In 1849, Neill arrived in the capital city of St. Paul less than two weeks after Minnesota was officially established as a U.S. territory.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> With rosy visions of Amherst on his mind, Neill hoped to establish a school in what was then the fast-growing Northwest region of the United States. However, it would take many tries for Neill to secure the right combination of mission, supporters, and funding in order to establish a school that would stand the test of time.</p>
