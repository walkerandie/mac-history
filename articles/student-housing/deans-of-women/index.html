<p>In the early 1900s, women were seen as having different needs from men when it came to education and student housing. Female students at colleges and universities in the United States, including Macalester, were often overseen by deans of women, who were responsible for “their charges’ involvement with cars, mixed-gender houses, food, and sex,” as described by Yanni.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Architecture was one way that college administrators could oversee their students and ensure their safety and morality.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In 1897, the college hired its first female professor, Julia Johnson, who also took on the role of Dean of Women and served as the house mother for The Elms, the residence for women located in the former president’s home. Residents of the Elms contributed an hour of work each day assisting the matron of the house— providing a way for women to learn how to properly manage a home.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> However, a dormitory designed specially for women would be ideal— it would keep them out of boardinghouses, which were seen as in opposition to a healthy learning environment, what with their lack of supervision and isolation from campus, and it would allow for special considerations for the wellbeing of female students in particular.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As the student body grew, it was clear that a much larger building would be needed to house female students. and plans were drawn up for what would become Wallace Hall.</p>
